			<h3>Beautiful animals</h3>

				<p>
					Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but
					has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area
					without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife was also synonymous to
					game: those birds and mammals that were hunted for sport. Deserts,
					forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including
					the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife.
					While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are
					untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife
					is affected by human activities.

					Crocodiles (family Crocodylidae) or true crocodiles are large
					semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia,
					the Americas and Australia. The term crocodile is sometimes used even
					more loosely to include all extant members of the order Crocodilia,
					which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the
					gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae) among other extinct
					taxa.. <br />

			<h3>Tiger</h3>
			<p>
				The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a
				member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark
				vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator,
				it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is
				territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring
				large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for
				prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for
				about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home
				range to establish their own. The tiger was first scientifically
				described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia
				Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south
				from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands. Since
				the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of
				their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central
				Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and
				South Asia and China. Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching
				from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on
				the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra. The tiger is listed as
				Endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger
				population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature
				individuals, with most of the populations living in small isolated
				pockets. India currently hosts the largest tiger population. Major
				reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat
				fragmentation and poaching. Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife
				conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population
				density. The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the
				world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in the ancient
				mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and
				continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on
				many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger
				is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.

			<h3>Wolf</h3>
			<div class="two-col">
				<p>
					The wolf (Canis lupus[b]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf,
					is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than
					thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray
					wolves, as popularly understood, comprise non-domestic/feral
					subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family
					Canidae. It is also distinguished species by its less pointed ears and
					muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is
					nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as
					the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with
					them.Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized
					for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical
					adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its
					highly advanced expressive behaviour including individual or group
					howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair
					accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own
					packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition
					for food within the pack.The global wild wolf population was estimated
					to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the
					International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Wolves have a
					long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and
					hunted in most pastoral communities.

					Because of their attacks on livestock, while conversely being
					respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies.The wolf is
					also considered the ancestor of the domestic dog. Although the fear of
					wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded
					attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from
					rabies. Wolf attacks on humans are rare because wolves are relatively
					few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans
					because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.The
					English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself
					thought to be derived from the Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The
					Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin
					word for the animal lupus (*lúkʷos).[5][6] The name "gray wolf" refers
					to the grayish colour of the species.[7] Since pre-Christian times,
					Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or
					suffix in their names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"),
					Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"), Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard
					("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone")
					Æðelwulf ("Noble Wolf"), Wolfhroc ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf
					Hide"), Scrutolf ("Garb Wolf"), Wolfgang ("Wolf Gait") and Wolfdregil
					("Wolf Runner").[8]
